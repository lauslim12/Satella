# Contributing

In order to contribute to this project, please follow these style guide and workflow.

## Coding Style Guide

Please follow this for the sake of the code to be as readable and maintainable as possible.

* **_Use your best spelling and punctuation, in English._**
* Please use `autopep8` package to format your code
* Please use `pylint` package to lint your code for any possible errors

Both `autopep8` and `pylint` are available in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Commit Style Guide

Please use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), but with past tense. For further details, please check [this gist](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716). Using these kinds of commit messages will make contributors into better programmers because of its rigid style. Another reason of using it is because its rigid style actually forces contributors to **not commit lots of files in one setting.**
